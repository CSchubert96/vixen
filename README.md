ViXeN: View eXtract and aNnotate media
=======================================

ViXeN is a simple tool to facilitate easily viewing, adding, annotating
metadata associated with media.  ViXeN has been designed primarily to assist
field biologists with managing the large amount of media they collect in
a minimally intrusive manner.

One may think of Vixen as a special, customizable file browser with which
one may view and edit metadata associated with media files like videos, images
and audio.
