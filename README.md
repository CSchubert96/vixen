ViXeN: View eXtract and aNnotate media
=======================================

ViXeN is a simple tool to facilitate easily viewing, adding, annotating
metadata associated with media.  ViXeN has been designed primarily to assist
field biologists with managing the large amount of media they collect in
a minimally intrusive manner.

One may think of Vixen as a special, customizable file browser with which
one may view and edit metadata associated with media files like videos, images
and audio.

History
--------

ViXeN was envisaged as a 'no-fuss' means to manage videos from 32 camera traps 
that were set up in the Banni grasslands in north-west India to survey species 
occurrence and interaction patterns, with a focus on carnivores. The research 
project began in 2013 and as of 2015 has resulted in 6000+ videos. When 
confronted with the daunting task of viewing and managing such volumes of 
media files, we realized that there was a dearth for tools to aid in the 
processing of such data. There were data managers for images but nothing suitable 
for video (and to a certain extent, audio) files.
